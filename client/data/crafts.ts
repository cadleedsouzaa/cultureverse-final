    location: "Channapatna, Karnataka", 
    desc: "Known as the 'Gombegala Ooru' (Toy Town), this craft dates back to the reign of Tipu Sultan, who invited Persian artisans to train locals in the art of wooden lac-turnery. The toys are traditionally made from 'Aale mara' (Ivory wood) and coated with eco-friendly vegetable dyes mixed with lac. The craft is protected as a Geographical Indication (GI) and is celebrated for its smooth, rounded edges and vibrant, non-toxic colors that are safe for children."

  'blue-pottery': { 
    title: "Jaipur Blue Pottery", 
    location: "Jaipur, Rajasthan", 
    desc: "A unique Turko-Persian art form that stands out because it uses no clay. Instead, the dough is prepared by mixing quartz stone powder, powdered glass, Multani Mitti (Fuller's Earth), borax, gum, and water. Brought to Jaipur by King Sawai Ram Singh II in the 19th century, it is famous for its semi-transparent bird and animal motifs painted in eye-catching cobalt blue and turquoise. It is low-fired, making it fragile but breathtakingly beautiful."

  'warli': { 
    title: "Warli Art", 
    location: "North Sahyadri Range, Maharashtra", 
    desc: "Practiced by the Warli and Malkhar Koli tribes, this ancient art form uses basic geometric shapes—a circle representing the sun and moon, a triangle derived from mountains and pointed trees, and a square indicating a sacred enclosure or a piece of land. The paintings are monosyllabic, created using white pigment made from a mixture of rice paste and water, with gum as a binder, on distinct ochre-red mud walls. They vividly depict social life, hunting, dancing (Tarpa dance), and sowing."

  'kolam': { 
    title: "Kolam", 
    location: "Tamil Nadu", 
    desc: "More than just art, Kolam is a daily ritual of mathematical beauty and spiritual discipline performed by women before sunrise. Drawn using rice flour (which feeds ants and insects, symbolizing charity), these geometric line drawings curve around a grid of dots (Pulli). It is believed to welcome Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity, into the home. The symmetry and complexity of the patterns are said to sharpen the mind and bring harmony to the household."

  'madhubani': { 
    title: "Madhubani Art", 
    location: "Mithila Region, Bihar", 
    desc: "Also known as Mithila painting, this folk art is traditionally done by women on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, though now also on canvas and cloth. It is characterized by eye-catching geometrical patterns and fills every inch of empty space with flowers, birds, and animals. The paintings use natural dyes extracted from plants (like turmeric and indigo) and are applied using fingers, twigs, brushes, and matchsticks to depict scenes from epics like the Ramayana and nature."
